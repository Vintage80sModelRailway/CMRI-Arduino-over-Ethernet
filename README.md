# CMRI-Arduino-over-Ethernet
An example library of Arduino C++ code providing a server for JMRI to connect and communicate CMRI over ethernet.

This essentially adds to Michael Adams' ArduinoCMRI 'Hello World' example, incorporating Ethernet support and basic sensor support.

It also uses his ArduinoCMRI library found here https://github.com/madleech/ArduinoCMRI

Compatible with JMRI 5.3.6 onwards as fixes to polling on the JMRI side are included only from that version on.
